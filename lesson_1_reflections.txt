How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It shows you only differences line for line of two files, so its very helpful
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can learn from mistakes you did in the past versions.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: you can deside which logic you are using to commit 
cons: you can forget to commit
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Its easier to handle when you see all files of a programm
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
with git log you see each version and git diff with the two comment you will see all difference between two versions
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always switch by using git checkout to older versions. But it looks like when you go back too far you will not come back to newer versions.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
for everything :)
